                                Web design satiates my desire to mix a profession that incorporates creativity with logic. My favorite part about web engineering is the sound of my keyboard clicking away as the image within my head slowly rounds into something malleable through a process of structuring a hypertext markup language, tweaking a cascading style sheet and wrestling with JavaScript. I tknow I need to take a break when my pointer finger fatigues from so much trackpad useage; which is what happens when I’m too lazy to plug my mouse in.

                        <p>In my spare time you can find me hidden in piles of fabric scraps and thread ends nesting their way into my hair. I started sewing just after my grandmother’s passing, who happened to be a seasoned seamstress herself. Her passing was paired with the passing of her mantle in textile design onto me. I’ve been sewing for 10 years now. I believe in creating more than I consume. I love a good sewing challenge and take commissions on the side, however lately I’ve been making lots and lots of baby blankets for all my friends with a bun in the oven.  </p>

                        <p>The best part upon exiting the airport is that first intake of foreign air. (awkwardly including those with heavy pollution) A week after graduating high school I found myself on an airplane headed to Switzerland to be a Jeune Fille Au Pair (nanny) for two amazing little boys. I spent a lot of my free time ding a fair bit of travelling. Among delving into the history, gazing upon period architecture and imersing myself amongst the locals, my favorite part about travelling abroad is the food! Bonus if they have a plethora of vegan options. </p>
